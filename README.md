# Movie_Recommendation_System
Introduction
All the OTT (over-the-top) platforms like Netflix, Amazon Prime, etc, use a movie recommender system to predict/filter the movies/items as per the user's behavior. An organization's goal is to retain a user on the platform for as long as possible so that it can make them as much money as feasible. Various machine learning algorithms can be used to fulfill the above requirement and better recommendations also result in more positive user feedback. Thus, in this hackathon, you have to develop a recommender system for movies.
## Problem Statement
To make a movie recommender system using a different machine-learning algorithm using the given dataset.Create an interactive application for the recommender system preferably using the python Tkinter library.
### Basic recommender system 
We create a Basic recommender system that gives the same recommendation to all the users irrespective of user preferences. It can be of two types - first, on the basis of movie popularity, and second, on the basis of movie popularity but it should be divided on the basis of genres.
#### Content-based recommender system
which is more personalized. In this, we use movie metadata which is the content of the movie which includes the movie director, casts, keywords, etc., and then compute similarities between the movie to build the engine.
## Collaborative filtering 
It is based on the idea that a user similar to me can be used to predict how much I will like the particular movie those users have experienced. You have to use different libraries and algorithms and try to use different metrics such as RMSE ( Root Mean SquareError ) or MAE ( Mean A absolute Error ) and give recommendations.
Produced Root Mean Squared Error of 0.9 and Mean Absolute Error of 0.7
